2. It then returns to the forehead above the center of the eye and moves down the head to the bottom of the skull.<br/>

3. It continues down the neck to the shoulder, descends the side of the body along the ribs, to the waist and pelvic. It continues down the outside of the leg, to the ankle, ending on the outside of the 4th toe. <br/>
